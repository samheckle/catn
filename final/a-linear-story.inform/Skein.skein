A Linear Story
An Interactive Fiction by Sam Heckle
Release 1 / Serial number 220502 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.34 lib 6/12N) SD

Death
Emerging from the Revelation, the journey finished, you take a deep breath. A seemingly endless labyrinth of thinking. A pattern only broken by Death itself. 

You think you see a gnarled old redwood tree out here.

 It didn't have to be this way. Maybe you can retrace your steps.

Revelation
It seems ages since you came to your last conclusion. You had a big idea, but not sure where it ran off to. You can end it here, embracing the eternal slumber. You remembered spiraling down there earlier. Do you remember what you were feeling so anxious about?

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thought patterns are doing no good here. You did stem from some type of thinking, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

Maybe there is a revelation soon if you wait awhile.

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thoughts float around the room, taunting you. You did start spiraling from some type of idea, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

Maybe there is a revelation soon if you wait awhile.

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thoughts float around the room, taunting you. You did start spiraling from some type of idea, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

You hit the flow, entering a thoughtful space. Maybe if you looked into an idea you might be able to find something. You can linger on the decision you had made. 

 You don't know if the choice was optional, something thrust upon you. You might end up spiraling, ruminating on the choices that you made. The choices that plague your mind.

An idea floats around.

Revelation
It seems ages since you came to your last conclusion. You had a big idea, but not sure where it ran off to. You can end it here, embracing the eternal slumber. You remembered spiraling down there earlier. Do you remember what you were feeling so anxious about?

Spiraling
Round and round we go again. Your cyclical thoughts float around the room, taunting you. You did start spiraling from some type of idea, but it seems there you have no logic here. Is this healthy? To stay here, thinking the same thought over and over, unable to break the pattern?

Maybe there is a revelation soon if you wait awhile.
